Adonis Linux Community Repository
==================================

*What is this?*

If you have a package you want included into the Adonis Linux repository, get a package together and submit a pull request.
I'll have a look at it, and if it seems worthwhile will be moved into the testing repository.
If there seems to be a warrant for it, it'll be moved into the main repository.

*What rules apply to packages?*

Package must be redistributable. All  licenses applied to it are in effect.
It's suggested that the source be available as well.

*How do I install these packages*

Get them from the deb's folder, or from the repository:
http://repsitory.adonislinux.com/ main 
http://repsitory.adonislinux.com/ testing

If warranted, this will branch into it's own repostiory.
